# movie-website

Hi there,

So, this is a "simple" movie website that I've created.

Open sourcing this for friends, to help them with their project.

By no means this website is encrypted, safe, nothing along these lines, just a simple proof of concept, that I(as a student) know and understand web development, to my tutor. Yes I got graded over this.
This website uses cookies to store the if user is admin, and the username. it can most definitely store "everything" the UserData has to offer, but for my needs, it has sufficed.

I'll be updating the description as I go along(time wise), but honestly, you should give it a try yourself.

Note current requirements are:
1. To have an SQL server installed.
2. (A) version of visual studio(not code) installed and be capable of running a website of aspx@/masterpage
3. Idk.. code always has some "error", but for me this works fine. *In a development windows 11 virtual machine.



I know that I added copyright infrigment rights against commerical use(and other stuff) and forgot to include credits where they are due, I understand the sin, but I never intended to release it to the public as a repository. The code is old, and I have no idea how to "reverse search code", like google lens has of images, but for code. And of course, credit is where is due, to the original owners, especially as per the animations of the login and register, they were made(a basic version with the animations) back in 2019.. Yes a lot of years ago, I have no clue from where I got the code for both, But I glad I did, both animations are absolutely amazing and the login and register wouldn't seem so alive and playful without them. I am greatly sorry for the original creators if at some point in the future it seems like I am the "creator" of the animations, which by no means I am. I hope it clears things up!


Full disclosure: I'm a GitHub newbie. Figured out the basics about three years ago, and now here we are. Still learning the ropes.

Alright, I'll leave it at that.
