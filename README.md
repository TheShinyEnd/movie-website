# movie-website

Hi there,

So, this is a "simple" movie website that I've created.

Open sourcing this for friends, to help them with their project.

By no means this website is encrypted, safe, nothing along these lines, just a simple proof of concept, that I(as a student) know and understand web development, to my tutor. Yes I got graded over this.
This website uses cookies to store the if user is admin, and the username. it can most definitely store "everything" the UserData has to offer, but for my needs, it has sufficed.

I'll be updating the description as I go along(time wise), but honestly, you should give it a try yourself.

Note current requirements are:
1. To have an SQL server installed.
2. (A) version of visual studio(not code) installed and be capable of running a website of aspx@/masterpage
3. Idk.. code always has some "error", but for me this works fine. *In a development windows 11 virtual machine.
